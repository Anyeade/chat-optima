# ✅ HTML Smart Update Migration Complete!

## What Was Changed

Your HTML artifact server (`artifacts/html/server.ts`) has been successfully replaced with the enhanced version that includes **5 alternative update methods** to solve the smart update issues.

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. **Automatic Method Selection**
The system now automatically chooses the best update method based on your request:

- **Regex Updates** → For titles, headers, footers
- **String Manipulation** → For simple text changes  
- **Template Updates** → For structural changes
- **Diff Updates** → For intelligent merging
- **Regex Block Replace** → For complex pattern-based replacements and block modifications
- **Smart Updates** → For precise targeting

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- Multiple fallback methods
- Clear console logging
- Graceful degradation to regular updates

### 3. **Performance Improvements**
- Faster string-based operations for simple changes
- Optimized regex patterns for common HTML elements
- Intelligent content analysis

## 🎯 How to Use

### Trigger Specific Methods

Use these keywords in your update requests:

```
"Change the title to 'New Title'"           → Uses regex method
"Simple: replace 'old' with 'new'"          → Uses string method  
"Add a new contact section"                 → Uses template method
"Smart update: modify the navigation"       → Uses smart method
"Intelligently merge these changes"         → Uses diff method
"Regex block: replace all buttons with new style" → Uses regex block method
"Complex: restructure the entire layout"    → Uses regex block method
```

### Monitor Updates

Check your console logs to see which method is being used:

```
Using update method: regex
Regex-based update method
Operation: title-update, success: true
```

## 🔧 What's Fixed

✅ **AI Model Inconsistency** → Multiple reliable fallback methods  
✅ **Complex Schema Validation** → Simplified, more reliable schemas
