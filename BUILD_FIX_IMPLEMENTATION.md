# Build Fix Implementation Summary

## Issue
After implementing the landing page, the Next.js build was failing with the error:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/vercel/path0/.next/server/app/(chat)/page_client-reference-manifest.js'
```

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Conflicting Route Structure**: API routes were duplicated in both `app/api/` and route groups `app/(chat)/api/` and `app/(auth)/api/`
2. **PPR Configuration Conflicts**: Partial Prerendering (PPR) was enabled in both `next.config.ts` and `app/(chat)/layout.tsx` causing build issues with route groups
3. **Client-side Redirect**: Root page was using client-side redirect which causes build issues
4. **Empty Configuration Files**: Empty `route-segment-config.ts` file was causing routing confusion

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Consolidated API Routes
- Moved all API routes from `app/(chat)/api/` to `app/api/`
- Moved all API routes from `app/(auth)/api/` to `app/api/`
- Removed empty `api` directories from route groups

### 2. Fixed Import Paths
- Updated import path in `app/api/chat/route.ts`:
  ```ts
  // Before: import { generateTitleFromUserMessage } from '../../actions';
  // After: import { generateTitleFromUserMessage } from '@/app/(chat)/actions';
  ```

### 3. Disabled PPR Configuration
- Commented out `ppr: true` in `next.config.ts`
- Commented out `experimental_ppr = true` in `app/(chat)/layout.tsx`

### 4. Fixed Root Page Redirect
- Changed from client-side to server-side redirect in `app/page.tsx`:
  ```ts
  // Removed 'use client' directive
  import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
  export default function HomePage() {
    redirect('/landing');
  }
  ```

### 5. Cleaned Up Configuration
- Removed empty `app/(chat)/route-segment-config.ts` file
- Cleared build cache with `rmdir /s /q .next`

## Build Status
- ✅ Route structure cleaned up
- ✅ API consolidation completed
- ✅ PPR conflicts resolved
- ✅ Import paths fixed
- ⏳ Build testing pending

## Next Steps
1. Test the build process to confirm the fix works
2. Re-enable PPR configuration once route group issues are resolved in future Next.js versions
3. Monitor for any remaining build issues
