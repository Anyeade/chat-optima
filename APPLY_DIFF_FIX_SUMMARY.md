# Apply Diff Tool Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The AI was generating malformed diff blocks when using the `applyDiff` tool to add stylish navigation menus to HTML documents.

### Error Details
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to apply diff: No valid SEARCH/REPLACE blocks found in diff.",
  "debug": {
    "contains_search_marker": true,
    "contains_replace_marker": false,
    "contains_equals": false,
    "diff_length": "1657 characters",
    "first_200_chars": "<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">..."
  }
}
```

## Root Cause
1. **Incomplete Diff Generation**: AI was generating diffs that started with `<<<<<<< SEARCH` but missing required `=======` separator and `>>>>>>> REPLACE` closing markers
2. **Confusing Prompt Instructions**: The format instructions used placeholder text `[OPEN]` and `[CLOSE]` which confused the AI
3. **Insufficient Examples**: Lacked clear, complete examples showing exact format requirements

## Files Modified

### 1. `/lib/ai/prompts.ts`
**Changes Made:**
- Replaced confusing placeholder format instructions with clear, descriptive text
- Added comprehensive example showing exact format for navigation menu addition
- Clarified that seven less-than/greater-than signs are required
- Removed ambiguous `[OPEN]` and `[CLOSE]` placeholders

**Before:**
```
- Format: [OPEN] SEARCH, :start_line:X, -------, exact text, =======, new text, [CLOSE] REPLACE
- Replace [OPEN] with <<<<<<< and [CLOSE] with >>>>>>>
```

**After:**
```
- EXACT FORMAT: Seven less-than signs, SEARCH, line number with colon prefix, dashes, exact text, seven equals, replacement, seven greater-than signs, REPLACE
```

### 2. `/lib/ai/tools/apply-diff.ts`
**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced error messages with specific guidance based on what markers are missing
- Added targeted fixes for common issues (missing separators, missing closing markers)
- Improved debugging information to help identify malformed diffs

**Before:**
```javascript
throw new Error(`No valid SEARCH/REPLACE blocks found in diff.\n\n${debugInfo}\n\nRequired format:...`);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Provide specific guidance based on what's missing
let guidance = '\nðŸ”§ COMMON FIXES:\n';
if (hasSearchMarker && !hasEquals) {
  guidance += '- Add "=======" separator between search and replace sections\n';
}
if (hasSearchMarker && !hasReplaceMarker) {
  guidance += '- Add ">>>>>>> REPLACE" at the end of your diff block\n';
}
// ... additional guidance
```

## Testing
Created `test-apply-diff.js` to verify:
- âœ… Valid diff format detection works correctly
- âœ… Invalid diff format is properly rejected
- âœ… Regex patterns correctly parse well-formed diffs
- âœ… Error handling improvements are functional

## Expected Results
With these fixes, the AI should now:

1. **Generate Complete Diffs**: Include all required markers (`<<<<<<< SEARCH`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> REPLACE`)
2. **Follow Exact Format**: Use proper line numbers, separators, and exact text matching
3. **Receive Clear Errors**: Get specific guidance when diffs are malformed
4. **Successfully Add Navigation**: Apply stylish menu additions to HTML documents

## Example of Correct Diff Format
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:8
-------
<body>
    <header>
=======
<body>
    <nav class="navbar">
        <div class="nav-brand">Logo</div>
        <ul class="nav-menu">
            <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <header>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

## Impact
- **Immediate**: Fixes the "add a stylish menu" request that was failing
- **Long-term**: Improves all `applyDiff` operations across the system
- **User Experience**: Provides clear error messages when diffs are malformed
- **AI Training**: Better prompt instructions reduce future formatting errors

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The apply-diff tool now properly validates and provides clear guidance for diff formatting issues.
