# AI API Timeout Optimization Summary

## 🎯 Problem Addressed
Fixed timeout issues in AI API requests that were causing premature termination of long streaming responses, especially during coding tasks where the AI might need extended time to generate comprehensive responses.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Main Chat API Route Timeout (app/api/chat/route.ts)
**Before:**
```typescript
export const maxDuration = 60; // 60 seconds
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const maxDuration = 300; // Increased to 5 minutes to support long AI streaming responses
```

**Impact:** Allows API routes to run for up to 5 minutes instead of 1 minute, supporting longer AI generation sessions.

### 2. Code Execution API Timeout (artifacts/code/client.tsx)
**Before:**
```typescript
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000); // 30 second timeout
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Increased timeout to 2 minutes for long-running AI operations
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 120000);
```

**Impact:** Code execution API requests now have 2 minutes instead of 30 seconds, allowing for longer AI processing during coding tasks.

### 3. Stream Resume Timeout (app/api/chat/route.ts)
**Before:**
```typescript
if (differenceInSeconds(resumeRequestedAt, messageCreatedAt) > 15) {
  return new Response(emptyDataStream, { status: 200 });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Allow longer resume window for AI streaming responses (60 seconds instead of 15)
if (differenceInSeconds(resumeRequestedAt, messageCreatedAt) > 60) {
  return new Response(emptyDataStream, { status: 200 });
}
```

**Impact:** Streaming responses can be resumed within 60 seconds instead of 15 seconds, reducing interruptions for long responses.

## ⏱️ New Timeout Configuration

| Component | Previous Timeout | New Timeout | Improvement |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Chat API Route | 60 seconds | 300 seconds (5 minutes) | 5x increase |
| Code Execution API | 30 seconds | 120 seconds (2 minutes) | 4x increase |
| Stream Resume Window | 15 seconds | 60 seconds | 4x increase |
| **Chutes AI MaxTokens** | **~4k tokens** | **32k tokens (DeepSeek)** | **8x increase** |

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Extended AI Generation Time**: AI models now have up to 5 minutes to generate comprehensive coding responses
2. **Reduced Interruptions**: Longer resume windows prevent premature termination of streaming responses
3. **Better Code Execution**: Code-related AI operations have 2 minutes for processing complex requests
4. **Improved User Experience**: Users can receive complete, uninterrupted AI responses for complex coding tasks
5. **🆕 Enhanced Token Limits**: Chutes AI DeepSeek models can generate 8x longer responses (32k vs 4k tokens)
6. **🆕 Full Context Utilization**: DeepSeek's 163k context window is now properly leveraged

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Vercel Function Limits
- Vercel Pro/Team plans support up to 300 seconds (5 minutes) for serverless functions
- Our new `maxDuration = 300` is at the maximum allowed limit for optimal performance

### AbortController Usage
- Maintained AbortController pattern for clean request cancellation
- Extended timeouts while preserving retry logic and error handling

### Streaming Resume Logic
- Increased resume window to handle longer AI processing times
- Maintains compatibility with existing resumable stream architecture

## 📝 Best Practices Implemented

1. **Progressive Timeouts**: Different timeout values for different use cases
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintained error handling and retry mechanisms
3. **Resource Optimization**: Balanced timeout increases with system resources
4. **User Feedback**: Clear timeout messages in error handling

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. Test long coding prompts that require extensive AI generation
2. Verify stream resumption works correctly with new timeout windows
3. Monitor Vercel function execution times to ensure they stay within limits
4. Test error handling when timeouts are reached

## 🔧 Future Considerations

1. **Dynamic Timeouts**: Consider implementing dynamic timeout based on request complexity
2. **Monitoring**: Add telemetry to track actual response times and adjust timeouts accordingly
3. **Caching**: Implement response caching for frequently requested coding patterns
4. **Chunked Responses**: Consider breaking very long responses into manageable chunks

## ✅ Validation

The timeout optimizations have been successfully implemented to:
- Support long-form AI streaming responses during coding tasks
- Prevent premature timeouts during complex AI generation
- Maintain system stability while maximizing response completeness
- Provide better user experience for AI-powered coding assistance

*This optimization ensures that AI responses can stream for extended periods, particularly beneficial for coding tasks where comprehensive, detailed responses are crucial.*
