# üéØ Smart HTML Artifact System - Anti-Template Guide

## Overview

The enhanced HTML artifact system now includes intelligent layout analysis that **prevents repetitive template generation** and creates **tailored layouts** based on specific user requirements. No more generic "contact form + testimonials + features" templates for every request!

## üß† Smart Layout Analysis

### How It Works

When a user requests a website, the system:

1. **Analyzes Project Type**: Detects if it's SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, landing page, etc.
2. **Determines Primary Purpose**: Lead generation, sales, showcase, information, etc.
3. **Identifies Target Audience**: Business, consumer, developer, creative, general
4. **Evaluates Layout Structure**: Single-page, multi-section, dashboard, landing, minimal
5. **Assesses Section Necessity**: Required vs optional vs avoid
6. **Prioritizes Content**: Based on user intent and project goals

### Example Analysis

**User Request**: "Create a simple portfolio for a photographer"

**Smart Analysis**:
- Project Type: `portfolio`
- Primary Purpose: `showcase`
- Target Audience: `creative`
- Layout Structure: `minimal`
- Required Sections: `hero`, `portfolio`, `contact`
- Avoided Sections: `testimonials`, `team`, `pricing`, `features`

**Result**: Clean, focused portfolio with only essential sections

## üö´ What It Prevents

### Before (Generic Template):
Every website request generated:
- Navigation
- Hero section
- Features section
- Testimonials
- Team section
- Contact form
- Footer

### After (Smart Analysis):
- **SaaS Dashboard**: Navigation, dashboard widgets, data visualization
- **Restaurant Site**: Hero, menu, location, hours (no testimonials!)
- **Product Landing**: Hero, features, pricing (no team section!)
- **Portfolio**: Hero, gallery, about (no contact form unless requested!)

## üéØ Component Selection Logic

### Navigation
- **Required**: Multi-section sites, business websites
- **Optional**: Single-page sites, minimal layouts
- **Avoided**: One-page portfolios, simple landing pages

### Hero Section
- **Required**: Most projects (provides context and first impression)
- **Optional**: Dashboard-style interfaces
- **Avoided**: When user explicitly requests "no hero"

### Features Section
- **Required**: SaaS, product pages, service websites
- **Optional**: Business websites
- **Avoided**: Portfolios, restaurants, simple showcases

### Contact Forms
- **Required**: When user mentions "contact", lead generation purpose
- **Optional**: Business websites
- **Avoided**: Portfolios, showcases, informational sites

### Testimonials
- **Required**: When explicitly requested
- **Optional**: Service-based businesses (only if mentioned)
- **Avoided**: Most other contexts (commonly overused)

### Team Section
- **Required**: When user mentions "team", "staff", "about us"
- **Optional**: Service businesses
- **Avoided**: Product sites, portfolios, landing pages
